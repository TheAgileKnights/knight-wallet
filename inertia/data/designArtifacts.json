          "question": "How do you keep track of who owes you money or who you owe money to?",
          "answer": "Recently she's been keeping a budget. Every single month she writes a new budget where she writes down each name of people she owes money to, how much she owes them, and the date when she needs to pay them. She acknowledged this system is 'very inefficient.'"

          "question": "What would make you feel more comfortable asking people to pay you back or reminding them about money they owe?",
          "answer": "For Hayley, the most comfortable approach is being straight up and direct. She's the type of person who doesn't beat around the bush—she would rather be straightforward and explain why she needs the money. She prefers asking people to pay rather than reminding them because 'reminding never gets done.'"

          "question": "If you could wave a magic wand and fix one thing about handling expenses, what would it be?",
          "answer": "Saving money would be the one thing she'd fix. She feels it's very hard to save money, especially monthly when there are so many bills to pay. Her biggest problem is trying to save money."

          "question": "How much time per week do you spend dealing with expense-related tasks like tracking spending, paying bills, or settling up with people?",
          "answer": "Hayley spends money every day and deals with expense-related considerations daily. However, she specifically tracks her expenses every Friday. Since she only works Monday through Friday, Friday is her bank day when she calculates all the money she made throughout the week and all the expenses she made throughout the week. This Friday tracking session takes about an hour, including the time to go to the bank and handle everything."
